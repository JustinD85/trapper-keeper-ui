# Trapper Keeper

## Project Description
  Trapper Keeper is an application that allows users to keep track of their to-do's by using a clean and stylish UI. The application can add and delete entire lists, as well as the ability to add and delete individual list items. All lists and their respective list data is stored and saved to a local backend.

## Project Development Notes:
Trapper Keeper's front-end was created with React, React Router, Redux, Redux Thunks, and Material UI. The application focused on practicing interactions between a locally created back-end, as well as practicing careful consideration of React and Redux best practices. Tests were written using Jest and Enzyme. 

## Future Development and Extensions Notes:
In the future, we would like to implement drag-and-drop functionality to save lists, therefore removing the 'Submit' button.
